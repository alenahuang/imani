      <h2>Pat Miller</h2>
      <p>Born and raised in South Bend I have a deep, abiding respect for and commitment to my community.  
          I lost both my older brother and sister to AIDS. 
          I began working in this field as a volunteer covering Intensive Out-Patient groups which eventually led to 
          employment. Through this work I gained a tremendous amount of experience in not only substance abuse, 
          but the correlation to risk behaviors that lead to HIV infection.  I eventually found my way to Imani Unidad.  
          I am happy to be a part of their passionate mission of spreading hope through education, 
          power through prevention and liberation through advocacy.</p>
