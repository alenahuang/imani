       Community Based Learning
     </h3>

    <div class="rinfo">
     <h4>
       Currently Imani Unidad works with the University of Notre Dame Center for Social Concerns (CSC) as a Community-Based Learning Coordination site. The CSC understands that the formal education of students who become involved in the local community extends beyond the classroom and that the students encounter people in the community who become their teachers as well as their supervisors. The Community-Based Learning Coordinators (CBLC) who work with the Center for Social Concerns are a great resource to students, and it is a pleasure to introduce students to some of the finest teachers in South Bend. The CBLCs are available to help students find placements in their agencies that meet both the needs of the community-based organization and the student. They are aware of the importance of finding ways to connect the students' real life experiences with their academic work. In addition, they are committed to making reflection a part of the student's experience in their organizations.

       In addition to working with students, the CBLCs serve as resources to faculty by assisting them in creating course-related community-based learning opportunities. The Center for Social Concerns is able to inform and educate students, faculty, and staff about community service and social action because of this valuable resource. The Community-Based Learning Coordinators are willing and able to find the right placements for students who come to them either individually or as part of a course related assignment.

  What is the Youth Reconciliation Process?
</h3>
<div class="rinfo">
<h4>
  Youth Reconciliation Process is an alternative to the juvenile justice system, and involves peer
led findings of fact and sanctioning of young people. The emphasis of a youth reconciliation
process is community based, law-related education, as young people volunteer to serve as jurors
and may also potentially have the roles akin to prosecuting attorney, defense attorney, bailiff, or
even judge. Law-related education, as facilitated in youth reconciliation, equips youth with the
ability to function effectively in a pluralistic, democratic society based on the rule of law. In
each case, both the student volunteers and the offenders learn about the laws that were broken,
consequences, and how due process is observed by courtroom procedure. Additionally, from
hands-on learning, both volunteers and offenders develop a greater understanding of concepts of
justice, power, equality, property, and liberty. Such concepts of which form the basis of strong
and humane values. Young offenders may voluntarily, with the consent of their parent or
guardian, choose to participate in the youth reconciliation process. Reconciliation packages
imposed upon a finding of fact , commonly include community service, jury duty, counseling,
educational workshops on substance abuse, drug testing, essay writing, victim-awareness classes,
and peer discussion groups. The Youth Reconciliation Process is for, but not limited to, first
time offenders under the age of 18, and the most common offenses include, but are not limited
to, theft, vandalism, alcohol use, disorderly conduct, assault, possession of marijuana, tobacco
use, and curfew violations. With the implementation of youth reconciliation, juvenile justice in
South Bend will shift from punitive to restorative, allowing for education, rehabilitation, and
empowerment.

Our goal is to create a community where the dynamic between the youth and the criminal justice
system is one with an emphasis on reconciliation, as opposed to retribution. We would like to
build, rehabilitate, and restore the youth who are victims of structural and cultural violence
through the implementation of a Youth Reconciliation Process in South Bend.
